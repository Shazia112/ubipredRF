# Abstract

Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification mechanism involving the ubiquitin protein's bonding to a substrate protein. It is crucial in a variety of physiological activities including cell survival and differentiation, and innate and adaptive immunity. Any alteration in the ubiquitin system leads to the development of various human diseases. Numerous researches show the highly reversibility and dynamic of ubiquitin system, making the experimental identification quite difficult. To solve this issue, this article develops a model using a machine learning approach, tending to improve the ubiquitin protein prediction precisely. We deeply investigate the
ubiquitination data that is proceed through different features extraction methods, followed by the classification. The evaluation and assessment are conducted considering Jackknife tests and 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed method demonstrated the remarkable performance in terms of 100%, 99.88%, and 99.84% accuracy on Dataset-I,
Dataset-II, and Dataset-III, respectively. Using Jackknife test, the method achieves 100%, 99.91%, and 99.99% for Dataset-I, Dataset-II and Dataset-III, respectively. This analysis concludes that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-arts to identify the ubiquitination sites and helpful in the development of current clinical therapies.
